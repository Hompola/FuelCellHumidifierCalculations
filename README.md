Fuelcell Humidifer Calculations
-
These files were created as a part of my Bachelor's degree final project. 
The code is written entirely in python, and the goal was to make it functional enough to use instead of focusing on aesthetics or semantic quality.
In that, I would reccomend using the code for its practical application. These are in detail:
<ol>
  <li>OptimalWaterVolumeCalculations module
    <ol>
      <li>Determines the number of water molecules consumed by the fuelcell at the given working paramteres</li>
      <li>The theory is based on the book Fuel Fundementals by Ryan O'Hayre et al. and therefore contains implementations of the book's formulas.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
